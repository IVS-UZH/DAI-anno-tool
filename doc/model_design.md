### Token organisation

The corpus consists of an ordered set of TOKENS. The tokens are organised into linear sequences of SPANS. A span is the domain of agreement and constituency annotations (meaning that these annotations cannot cross spans).  Tokens can be added and removed from spans. Furthermore, we can also delete spans as well.
